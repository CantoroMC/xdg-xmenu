.SH NAME
xdg-xmenu - generate an XDG desktop menu file for
.IR xmenu (1)
.SH SYNOPSIS
[ \fIENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES\fR ]
.B xdg-xmenu
.SH DESCRIPTION
xdg-xmenu is a shell script to generate an XDG desktop menu file for xmenu.
.P
.B Desktop Files: 
The script will go through the .desktop files in the following directories:
$XDG_DATA_DIRS/applications, $XDG_DATA_HOME/applications.
.P
.B Icon Files:
xdg-xmenu will find the icons in the following directories (loosely \
following the method in the freedesktop.org specification):
$XDG_DATA_DIRS/icons, $XDG_DATA_HOME/icons.
.SH Output
.B Images:
Since
.IR xmenu (1)
does not support svg format as icons, this script will convert the found svg
files to png images and cache them in $XDG_CACHE_HOME/xdg-xmenu/.
By default, png and xpm icons will be copied to the cache folder.
.P
.B Menu:
The script will output the menu that can be used by
.IR xmenu (1)
in stdout. You can run this command to use it:
.P
xdg-menu > menu; xmenu < menu | sh &
.P
It's not recommended to pipe the output to xmenu due to the speed.
.SH DEPENDENCIES

.IR convert (1)
This command is provided by
.IR ImageMagick (1)
.TP
.IR inkscape (1)

.IR xmenu (1),
.IR rsvg-convert (1)

The implementation does not cover everything in the freedesktop specifications,
so it is possible that a desktop entry is parsed incorrectly or an icon is not found.
